Hi! I'm a web developer/designer based in Perth, Western Australia. 

You can view my past projects [here](https://maddieclare.github.io/Portfolio/) or contact me via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codingforcatpeople/) about anything coding-related (baby animal pictures, fun trivia and/or good-bad puns also welcome).
